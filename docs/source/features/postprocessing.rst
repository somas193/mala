FESL provides routines to calculate quantities of interests from the physical
data such as the LDOS, DOS and electronic density.

LDOS
*****

The LDOS can be used to calculate the number of electrons and band energy
(both via the DOS) and the total energy (via the DOS and the electronic
density) of a system. In order to do that, the LDOS is usually integrated
either on the spatial or the energy grid, yielding the DOS or density
respectively.

DOS
***

The DOS can be used to calculate the number of electrons and band energy
as well as the entropy contribution to the total energy.


Density
*******

The Density can be used to calculate the number of electrons and density
based contributions to the total energy.
